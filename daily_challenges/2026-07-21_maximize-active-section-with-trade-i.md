## Problem Description

You are given a binary string s of length n, where:


	&#39;1&#39; represents an active section.
	&#39;0&#39; represents an inactive section.


You can perform at most one trade to maximize the number of active sections in s. In a trade, you:


	Convert a contiguous block of &#39;1&#39;s that is surrounded by &#39;0&#39;s to all &#39;0&#39;s.
	Afterward, convert a contiguous block of &#39;0&#39;s that is surrounded by &#39;1&#39;s to all &#39;1&#39;s.


Return the maximum number of active sections in s after making the optimal trade.

Note: Treat s as if it is augmented with a &#39;1&#39; at both ends, forming t = &#39;1&#39; + s + &#39;1&#39;. The augmented &#39;1&#39;s do not contribute to the final count.

&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: s = &quot;01&quot;

Output: 1

Explanation:

Because there is no block of &#39;1&#39;s surrounded by &#39;0&#39;s, no valid trade is possible. The maximum number of active sections is 1.


Example 2:


Input: s = &quot;0100&quot;

Output: 4

Explanation:


	String &quot;0100&quot; &rarr; Augmented to &quot;101001&quot;.
	Choose &quot;0100&quot;, convert &quot;101001&quot; &rarr; &quot;100001&quot; &rarr; &quot;111111&quot;.
	The final string without augmentation is &quot;1111&quot;. The maximum number of active sections is 4.



Example 3:


Input: s = &quot;1000100&quot;

Output: 7

Explanation:


	String &quot;1000100&quot; &rarr; Augmented to &quot;110001001&quot;.
	Choose &quot;000100&quot;, convert &quot;110001001&quot; &rarr; &quot;110000001&quot; &rarr; &quot;111111111&quot;.
	The final string without augmentation is &quot;1111111&quot;. The maximum number of active sections is 7.



Example 4:


Input: s = &quot;01010&quot;

Output: 4

Explanation:


	String &quot;01010&quot; &rarr; Augmented to &quot;1010101&quot;.
	Choose &quot;010&quot;, convert &quot;1010101&quot; &rarr; &quot;1000101&quot; &rarr; &quot;1111101&quot;.
	The final string without augmentation is &quot;11110&quot;. The maximum number of active sections is 4.



&nbsp;
Constraints:


	1 &lt;= n == s.length &lt;= 105
	s[i] is either &#39;0&#39; or &#39;1&#39;
