## Problem Description

You are given a binary string s and a positive integer k.

A substring of s is beautiful if the number of 1&#39;s in it is exactly k.

Let len be the length of the shortest beautiful substring.

Return the lexicographically smallest beautiful substring of string s with length equal to len. If s doesn&#39;t contain a beautiful substring, return an empty string.

A string a is lexicographically larger than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, a has a character strictly larger than the corresponding character in b.


	For example, &quot;abcd&quot; is lexicographically larger than &quot;abcc&quot; because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and d is greater than c.


&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: s = &quot;100011001&quot;, k = 3
Output: &quot;11001&quot;
Explanation: There are 7 beautiful substrings in this example:
1. The substring &quot;100011001&quot;.
2. The substring &quot;100011001&quot;.
3. The substring &quot;100011001&quot;.
4. The substring &quot;100011001&quot;.
5. The substring &quot;100011001&quot;.
6. The substring &quot;100011001&quot;.
7. The substring &quot;100011001&quot;.
The length of the shortest beautiful substring is 5.
The lexicographically smallest beautiful substring with length 5 is the substring &quot;11001&quot;.


Example 2:


Input: s = &quot;1011&quot;, k = 2
Output: &quot;11&quot;
Explanation: There are 3 beautiful substrings in this example:
1. The substring &quot;1011&quot;.
2. The substring &quot;1011&quot;.
3. The substring &quot;1011&quot;.
The length of the shortest beautiful substring is 2.
The lexicographically smallest beautiful substring with length 2 is the substring &quot;11&quot;.


Example 3:


Input: s = &quot;000&quot;, k = 1
Output: &quot;&quot;
Explanation: There are no beautiful substrings in this example.


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 100
	1 &lt;= k &lt;= s.length
