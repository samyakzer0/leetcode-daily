## Problem Description

You are given an integer array nums of length n and an integer k.

You must select exactly k distinct non-empty subarrays nums[l..r] of nums. Subarrays may overlap, but the exact same subarray (same l and r) cannot be chosen more than once.

The value of a subarray nums[l..r] is defined as: max(nums[l..r]) - min(nums[l..r]).

The total value is the sum of the values of all chosen subarrays.

Return the maximum possible total value you can achieve.

Example 1:


Input: nums = [1,3,2], k = 2

Output: 4

Explanation:

One optimal approach is:


	Choose nums[0..1] = [1, 3]. The maximum is 3 and the minimum is 1, giving a value of 3 - 1 = 2.
	Choose nums[0..2] = [1, 3, 2]. The maximum is still 3 and the minimum is still 1, so the value is also 3 - 1 = 2.


Adding these gives 2 + 2 = 4.


Example 2:


Input: nums = [4,2,5,1], k = 3

Output: 12

Explanation:

One optimal approach is:


	Choose nums[0..3] = [4, 2, 5, 1]. The maximum is 5 and the minimum is 1, giving a value of 5 - 1 = 4.
	Choose nums[1..3] = [2, 5, 1]. The maximum is 5 and the minimum is 1, so the value is also 4.
	Choose nums[2..3] = [5, 1]. The maximum is 5 and the minimum is 1, so the value is again 4.


Adding these gives 4 + 4 + 4 = 12.

Constraints:


	1 &lt;= n == nums.length &lt;= 5 * 10​​​​​​​4
	0 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 109
	1 &lt;= k &lt;= min(105, n * (n + 1) / 2)
