## Problem Description

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters and the special characters: &#39;*&#39;, &#39;#&#39;, and &#39;%&#39;.

You are also given an integer k.

Build a new string result by processing s according to the following rules from left to right:


	If the letter is a lowercase English letter append it to result.
	A &#39;*&#39; removes the last character from result, if it exists.
	A &#39;#&#39; duplicates the current result and appends it to itself.
	A &#39;%&#39; reverses the current result.


Return the kth character of the final string result. If k is out of the bounds of result, return &#39;.&#39;.

&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: s = &quot;a#b%*&quot;, k = 1

Output: &quot;a&quot;

Explanation:


	
		
			i
			s[i]
			Operation
			Current result
		
	
	
		
			0
			&#39;a&#39;
			Append &#39;a&#39;
			&quot;a&quot;
		
		
			1
			&#39;#&#39;
			Duplicate result
			&quot;aa&quot;
		
		
			2
			&#39;b&#39;
			Append &#39;b&#39;
			&quot;aab&quot;
		
		
			3
			&#39;%&#39;
			Reverse result
			&quot;baa&quot;
		
		
			4
			&#39;*&#39;
			Remove the last character
			&quot;ba&quot;
		
	


The final result is &quot;ba&quot;. The character at index k = 1 is &#39;a&#39;.


Example 2:


Input: s = &quot;cd%#*#&quot;, k = 3

Output: &quot;d&quot;

Explanation:


	
		
			i
			s[i]
			Operation
			Current result
		
	
	
		
			0
			&#39;c&#39;
			Append &#39;c&#39;
			&quot;c&quot;
		
		
			1
			&#39;d&#39;
			Append &#39;d&#39;
			&quot;cd&quot;
		
		
			2
			&#39;%&#39;
			Reverse result
			&quot;dc&quot;
		
		
			3
			&#39;#&#39;
			Duplicate result
			&quot;dcdc&quot;
		
		
			4
			&#39;*&#39;
			Remove the last character
			&quot;dcd&quot;
		
		
			5
			&#39;#&#39;
			Duplicate result
			&quot;dcddcd&quot;
		
	


The final result is &quot;dcddcd&quot;. The character at index k = 3 is &#39;d&#39;.


Example 3:


Input: s = &quot;z*#&quot;, k = 0

Output: &quot;.&quot;

Explanation:


	
		
			i
			s[i]
			Operation
			Current result
		
	
	
		
			0
			&#39;z&#39;
			Append &#39;z&#39;
			&quot;z&quot;
		
		
			1
			&#39;*&#39;
			Remove the last character
			&quot;&quot;
		
		
			2
			&#39;#&#39;
			Duplicate the string
			&quot;&quot;
		
	


The final result is &quot;&quot;. Since index k = 0 is out of bounds, the output is &#39;.&#39;.


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 105
	s consists of only lowercase English letters and special characters &#39;*&#39;, &#39;#&#39;, and &#39;%&#39;.
	0 &lt;= k &lt;= 1015
	The length of result after processing s will not exceed 1015.
