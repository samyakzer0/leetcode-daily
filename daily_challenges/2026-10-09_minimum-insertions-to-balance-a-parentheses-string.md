## Problem Description

Given a parentheses string s containing only the characters &#39;(&#39; and &#39;)&#39;. A parentheses string is balanced if:


	Any left parenthesis &#39;(&#39; must have a corresponding two consecutive right parenthesis &#39;))&#39;.
	Left parenthesis &#39;(&#39; must go before the corresponding two consecutive right parenthesis &#39;))&#39;.


In other words, we treat &#39;(&#39; as an opening parenthesis and &#39;))&#39; as a closing parenthesis.


	For example, &quot;())&quot;, &quot;())(())))&quot; and &quot;(())())))&quot; are balanced, &quot;)()&quot;, &quot;()))&quot; and &quot;(()))&quot; are not balanced.


You can insert the characters &#39;(&#39; and &#39;)&#39; at any position of the string to balance it if needed.

Return the minimum number of insertions needed to make s balanced.

&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: s = &quot;(()))&quot;
Output: 1
Explanation: The second &#39;(&#39; has two matching &#39;))&#39;, but the first &#39;(&#39; has only &#39;)&#39; matching. We need to add one more &#39;)&#39; at the end of the string to be &quot;(())))&quot; which is balanced.


Example 2:


Input: s = &quot;())&quot;
Output: 0
Explanation: The string is already balanced.


Example 3:


Input: s = &quot;))())(&quot;
Output: 3
Explanation: Add &#39;(&#39; to match the first &#39;))&#39;, Add &#39;))&#39; to match the last &#39;(&#39;.


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 105
	s consists of &#39;(&#39; and &#39;)&#39; only.
